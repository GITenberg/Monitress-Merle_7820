description: The warm, mellow September sunshine was streaming over the irregular
  roofs and twisted chimneys of the little town of Chagmouth, and was glinting on
  the water in the harbour, and sending gleaming, straggling, silver lines over the
  deep reflections of the shipping moored by the side of the jetty. The rising tide,
  lapping slowly and gently in from the ocean, was floating the boats beached on the
  shingle, and was gradually driving back the crowd of barefooted children who had
  ventured out in search of mussels, and was sending them, shrieking with mirth, scampering
  up the seaweed-covered steps that led to the fish market. On the crag-top above
  the town the corn had been cut, and harvesters were busy laying the sheaves together
  in stooks. The yellow fields shone in the afternoon light as if the hill were crowned
  with gold. Walking along the narrow cobbled path that led past the harbour and up
  on to the cliff, Mavis and Merle looked at the scene around with that sense of rejoicing
  proprietorship with which we are wont to revisit the pet place of our adoption.
  It was two whole months since they had been in Chagmouth, and as they both considered
  the little town to be the absolute hub of the universe it was really a great event
  to find themselves once more in its familiar streets. They had spent the summer
  holidays with their father and mother in the north, and had come back to Durracombe
  just in time for the reopening of school.
